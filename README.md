# simple-parking-app
This is the final project of my first semester in college.

It's from the Introduction to Programming and Logic College Course.

It's a source code of a parking program that is written in Indonesian Language.

Here are the rules from the lecturer:
1. Variables and data types
2. Constant
3. Branching
4. Looping
5. Function
6. Alternative flow handling for error handling
7. Exceptions
8. Using lists or dictionaries

The code doesn't include classes whatsoever as I can't use it, in accordance to rule above.

So here it is, a mess and in need of a lot of improvement of course.

Feel free to use it in your project! It would be kind for you if you mention me or dm me if you use the code!

Anyway, thanks for reading this... I hope you can learn more from the code..!
